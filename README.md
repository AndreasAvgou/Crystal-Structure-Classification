# Problem Statement

There have been numerous studies of perovskite structures in the field of ceramic science and engineering, materials physics, and solid-state inorganic chemistry owing to their compositional flexibility, distortion of the cation configuration, and mixed valence state electronic structure. 
This has prompted scientists to tune the materialâ€™s properties so as to obtain a much more ideal perovskite structure. An ideal perovskite has an ABX3 structure where A and B are two differently sized cations, and X is an anion
A total of 73 elements have been identified in the A and B sites of ABO3 structures, leading to numerous oxides of the perovskite type. Features such as electronegativity, ionic radius, valence, and bond lengths of A-O and B-O pairs have been identified that enable a priori crystal structure prediction.
